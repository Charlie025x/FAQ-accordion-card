## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox has kept my card's child divs evenly spaced in my past projects, however not on this one due to the images affecting the divs porportions, in the desktop view. I was able to keep my card even with 

```css
.faq-container, .image-container {
  flex: 1; /*splits card in half */
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not confident in javascript DOM manipulation, I didn't even touch the javascript after copying the according code from w3shools. I'll likely have a better understanding of javascript DOM as I practice React in the future, skipping vanila javascript DOM practice.

### Useful resources
