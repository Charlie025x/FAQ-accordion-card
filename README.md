## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox has kept my card's child divs evenly spaced in my past projects, however not on this one due to the images affecting the divs porportions, in the desktop view. I was able to keep my card even with 

```css
.faq-container, .image-container {
  flex: 1; /*splits card in half */
}
```

### Continued development

Image positioning is still a work in progress. I'm currently posistioning my images with something like
```css
.img {
  position: relative ;
  right: 10px;
  bottom: 10px;
}
```
 But my images move around as I resize my window. Will further look into improving.

 My background gradient doesn't extend with my page's growth due to using the accordion. Leaving a purple bar in the bottom of the page.

### Useful resources
